# bos-bikes

This module is a command line interface that gets you the real-time info on Hubway stations. Bikes available - docks available of a particular station.

## Installation
```
  > npm install -g bos-bikes
```

> Don't forget the "-g" to install it globally. (then you can run the bikes command anywhere)

## Usage

On your terminal:
```
  > bikes `station-id`
```
Basically the bikes command and whatever station you want to check.

At first, you will obviously not know the id of a particular station.
You can get that with the command `bikes`. It is a deliberate api design decision. The reality is that you most frequently use only 3 to 4 stations anyways. By your fourth use, you will know the id by heart (one or two digits). Then you can pretty much make the query in less a second.
